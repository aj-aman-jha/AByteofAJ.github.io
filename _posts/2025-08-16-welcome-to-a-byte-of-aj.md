**A Byte of AJ** focuses on practical posts for builders. Expect code you can copy, tool breakdowns, and experiments explained clearly.

## Why another tech blog?

Because most tutorials are either too long or too fluffy. Here you'll get **tight explanations** and **copyâ€‘ready snippets**.

```bash
# Example: create a new Jekyll post
bundle exec jekyll post "My next post"
```
